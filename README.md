### What I learned

I start by using the illustration image as a background in my css, but that make it harder for me when positioning my elements, so i change it to the html. I used ``` { display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; }``` for every division. Using ``` max-widht ``` makes the widht compatible with desktop and phone sizes. I learned how to make the border radius for only the top of an image using ```border-top-left-radius``` and ```border-top-right-radius```. I used anchor tags to make some buttons buttons, because ```<button>``` trigger an action like toggling content or submitting a form, If it trigger navigation it must be anchor tags, then i put ```text-decoration: none;``` to cancel the underline decoration for anchors. For more decoration i used some shadow for the button like ```box-shadow: 0 8px 30px -12px hsl(245, 75%, 52%);``` and when hovering i changed the color and add a time for the transition.
